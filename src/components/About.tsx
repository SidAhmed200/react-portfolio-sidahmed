                    Hi, I'm Sidahmed Mekiri, a Master 1 Software Engineering student and Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for technology and innovation. I specialize in web development, artificial intelligence, and data-driven solutions. Over the years, I have gained experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications, designing efficient algorithms, and working with databases and cloud technologies.
                    I enjoy turning creative ideas into real digital solutions, writing clean, maintainable, and optimized code. I am particularly fascinated by AI and machine learning, exploring ways to make software smarter and more adaptive to user needs. Beyond coding, I am committed to continuous learning, keeping up with the latest trends in software development, and contributing to projects that have a meaningful impact.
